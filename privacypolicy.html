    <h1>No More Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="readable">
      <p><i>No More</i> doesn't collect, track, or store any personally identifiable information. When you open the <i>No More</i> app, it sends a few things to a private server I made and control:<p>
        <ul>
          <li>A random identifier unique to your installation of the app</li>
          <li>The version of the app, iOS operating system, and of the <i>No More</i> settings you're using</li>
          <li>What, if anything, has been purchased</li>
          <li>What rules are currently enabled</li>
        </ul>
      <p><i>No More</i> doesn't share that data with anyone. We do log and store data in order to help us debug the app, though only I am authorized access to those systems. <i>No More</i> does not connect your information to advertising or other tracking systems.</p>
      <p>Also, I pledge to delete any and all user-related data if <i>No More</i> or Strings.fm Inc. ever changes control to someone other than me, Andrew Konoff.</p>
      <p>In effect as of June 4, 2020.</p>
